# MandelbrotSetCPP
A relatively basic program which renders the Mandelbrot set. The user can use the arrow keys to translate the Mandelbrot set, and the Z and X keys to zoom in and out of the Mandelbrot set respectively. As a result of how my OpenGL library (and OpenGL in general) is quite limited when it comes to individual pixel manipulation, only some points have been rendered to represent the Mandelbrot set.
